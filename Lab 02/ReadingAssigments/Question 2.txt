Question:
- If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?
Answer:
Yes, Java allows you to create multiple constructors in the same class, a concept known as constructor overloading. Each constructor must have a unique parameter list, so Java can tell them apart when you create an object.
